# KinMethyl

**KinMethyl** is a deep learning framework for detecting methylation especially 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from PacBio SMRT sequencing data.  It integrates regression-based unmethylated kinetics modeling of with classifier to improve detection performance.

## Features

- Sequence-to-kinetics regression from WGA data
- Fusion of raw and predicted IPD/PW signals with sequence
- Support for multiple methylation types: 5mC, 6mA, 4mC
