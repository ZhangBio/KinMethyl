# KinMethyl

**KinMethyl** is a deep learning framework for detecting methylation especially 5-methylcytosine (5mC) from PacBio SMRT sequencing data.  It integrates regression-based unmethylated kinetics modeling of with classifier to improve detection performance.

## Features

- Sequence-to-kinetics regression from WGA data
- Fusion of raw and predicted IPD/PW signals with sequence
- Support for multiple methylation types: 5mC, 6mA, 4mC

# Usage
We are in the process of preparing example scripts and detailed usage instructions for this repository.  
In the meantime, all core model training and prediction scripts are available in the top-level directory.
